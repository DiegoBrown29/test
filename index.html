            <p><h1><i> A Deep Dive Into <b>Mixed Martial Arts</b> (MMA)</p></h1></i>
            
            <p><h2><b> Intro </b></p></h2>
           
            <p><h4>Mixed martial arts (or MMA)is not for the queasy, nor the easily disturbed. 
            While it is a violent and at times gory sport, it can also be graceful.
            "How can such a violent sport be graceful?" you may ask. Allow me to explain.
            Mixed Martial Arts is made up primarily of -but is not limited to- five major martial arts: 
            Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, boxing and kickboxing. 
            Again, though these are the most popular, there are many different styles that you can use in a MMA bout. 
            It has been seen that martial arts such as Kung Fu, Karate and (now making it's way into the mainstream) Judo have been seen, 
            though typically many MMA fighters stick to the basic five. No sport is easy, all take a level of technique and are physically demanding,
            and MMA is no exception. Many (including me) consider MMA to be the most physically and mentally demanding sport on the planet. 
            MMA takes extreme discipline, and no doubt takes a physical toll, requiring a fighter to not only deliver, but take heavy strikes to he head and body. 
            In order for you to get a better grasp on MMA, I will go over the rules of the sport, the weight classes and some of the most promising prospects in the sport. . 
            Allow me to take you throught the brilliant and complex
            sport of Mixed Martial Arts.</p></h4>
            
            <p><h2><b> Rules </b></p></h2>
            
            <p><h4>There are little, but important rules in the sport of MMA. In such a violent sport, following the rules can prevent very serious injuries.
            For example, there is a rule against hitting your opponent in the back or especially in the back of the head. 
            Think what would happen if someone took a brutal strike to the spine, the results could be catastrophic for the victim. 
            Other rules meant to protect the fighters are rules such as these: no eye gouging or fish hooking (placing your finger in the opponents mouth) of any kind,-or really any other gouging that you an think of-, 
            no kicks or knee strikes to an opponent that is grounded, no throwing an opponent to the ground by their head or neck, 
            no head butting, no hair pulling and no groin strikes. Lastly the most important rule of them all: follow the referee's instruction at all time.
            Failure to follow the referee's instruction can and almost always will end in disqualification. 
            Amongst these rules, there are more small technicalities that you must follow. But those are some of the most basic rules;
            even in a fighting sport -which many consider to be barbaric already- there is still a system, after all, we are not animals. </h4>
            
            <p><h2><b> Weight Classes </b></h2></p>
            
            <p><h4>MMA is split into weight classes to ensure that the fight is fair. We wouldn't want to see a giant 260 pound man crush a mere 150 pound figher.
            Weight classes depend on the league of mma that you are watching. Here is a table to help you understand the UFC (ultimate fighting championsip; one of the most popular leagues)</h4>

  <a href= "khamzat.jpeg"><img src= "khamzat.jpeg"></a>
  <p><h3>Khamzat Chimaev<h3>
  <p><h4>Khamzat Chimaev is one of the best fighters of the generation, and one of the most promising prospects. Though he missed the fight of
  his career with Nate Diaz (my personal favorite fighter) because he missed weight, he still remains a brilliant and strategic fighter. He is a 
  3 time wrestling national champion in Sweden, and is very entertaining to watch. He quickly rose to the top most dangerous fighters in he division.
